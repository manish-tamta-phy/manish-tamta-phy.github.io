Books Catalog For Undergraduate and Graduate Physics Students


Most of the students often find it difficult to choose a book for studying a particular branch in physics. Though there are many standard books available. Nevertheless you should always feel free to choose a book which best fits you. You should never judge a book by its cover, author or anything for that matter. I strongly recommend you to explore available books and then decide which book is meant for you. Since without reading a book you can't tell whether it is a good book or not. Second thing which we should consider is notation and language of the author (by language i mean explanation). For instance if you find some book (whether or not it is popular) very understandable, you should definitely go for it.

Now, considering you have done enough exploration and still in doubt from where to start. This article gives you a glimpse of a few standard and few advanced level books which will help you in understanding the literature. Afterall we need to train ourselves to understand more technical research papers and produce our own research. In this sense books are our best friend which will form a base for us.
